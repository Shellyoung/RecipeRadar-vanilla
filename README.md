# Recipe Radar

##Description
Recipe Radar is a World of Warcraft UI addon that assists players in finding recipes. It knows about vendors who sell recipes in the current region or by profession. It has a number of filtering options and can even locate vendors on the world map.

When you get in game, you may want to map a key to toggle Recipe Radar.
You should be able to find the option to do this in your Key Bindings menu,
all the way at the bottom.  Otherwise, you can hit the new icon on your
minimap to open Recipe Radar or use the slash command, '/rrdr'.
